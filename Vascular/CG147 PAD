# NICE CG147 – Management of Critical Limb Ischaemia

**Source:** NICE guideline CG147 – *Peripheral arterial disease: diagnosis and management*  
Recommendations relevant to critical limb ischaemia (CLI)  
https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg147/chapter/recommendations :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

This summary focuses on management recommendations for people with **critical limb ischaemia** — a severe, end-stage form of peripheral arterial disease where blood flow is insufficient to meet tissue needs. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

## What Is Critical Limb Ischaemia?

Critical limb ischaemia is a severe manifestation of peripheral arterial disease, characterised by:

- **Rest pain** that persists and prevents sleep  
- **Ischaemic ulcers**, non-healing wounds or  
- **Gangrene** of the foot or toes

People with CLI are at high risk of limb loss (amputation) and premature death unless treated appropriately. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

## Key Management Actions

### Multidisciplinary Vascular Assessment

- Ensure that all people with **critical limb ischaemia** are assessed by a **vascular multidisciplinary team (MDT)** before deciding on treatment.  
  - This may include vascular surgeons, interventional radiologists, specialist nurses and podiatry. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

---

### Revascularisation Strategy

- **Revascularisation** is the cornerstone of CLI management to restore blood flow and prevent limb loss.  
- Decisions about revascularisation should be based on:
  - Clinical assessment  
  - Anatomical imaging (duplex, CTA or MRA)  
  - Functional status and comorbidity  

**Options include:**
- **Endovascular interventions** (e.g., angioplasty ± stenting)  
- **Surgical bypass grafting**  
- The choice depends on lesion location, severity, patient fitness, and available expertise. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}

### When Not to Offer Major Amputation First

- Do **not offer major amputation** to people with CLI unless **all options for revascularisation** have been considered by the vascular multidisciplinary team.  
- Amputation may ultimately be necessary in some cases, but should not be first-line without MDT discussion. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}

---

### Imaging for Revascularisation Planning

- Use **non-invasive vascular imaging** to guide choice and planning of intervention:
  - **Duplex ultrasound** as first-line imaging for revascularisation planning  
  - **Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography (MRA)** if duplex is inconclusive or further detail is required  
  - **Computed tomography angiography (CTA)** when MRA is contraindicated or not tolerated  
- Imaging should be integrated with the clinical plan before intervention. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}

---

### Risk Factor Management and Prevention

- Address modifiable risk factors that contribute to peripheral arterial disease progression:
  - Smoking cessation  
  - Lipid modification and statin therapy  
  - Blood pressure control  
  - Diabetes management  
  - Antiplatelet therapy for cardiovascular risk reduction  
- CLI reflects advanced systemic atherosclerosis; aggressive risk factor control may improve outcomes. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}

---

### Supportive and Adjunctive Care

- Provide appropriate **pain management**, often requiring specialist input.  
- Manage **ulceration and infection** with wound care specialists and antibiotics as needed.  
- Consider **anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy** according to cardiovascular risk profiles.

## Summary – CLI Referral & Imaging Actions

- Urgent **vascular MDT assessment** for all CLI cases. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}  
- **Revascularisation planning** guided by duplex/MRA/CTA imaging. :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}  
- **Do not proceed to major amputation** without revascularisation attempts discussed by MDT. :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}  
- Address **cardiovascular risk factors** aggressively to limit disease progression. :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}
