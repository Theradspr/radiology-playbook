This page summarises recommended management of people with suspected acute cholecystitis, with emphasis on referral, imaging, resuscitation and escalation.

---

## Initial Hospital Assessment

- People with suspected acute cholecystitis should be **admitted to hospital** for assessment and management. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  
- Assess for systemic features such as:
  - Fever
  - Tachycardia
  - Rigours
  - Sepsis or haemodynamic instability :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

---

## Initial Clinical Management

### Supportive Care

- Start **analgesia** for pain control. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}  
- Initiate **IV fluids** for hydration and sepsis management if required. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}  
- If features of systemic infection are present, consider **empirical broad-spectrum antibiotics** according to local antimicrobial policy. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}

---

## Diagnostic Imaging

### Abdominal Ultrasound

- **Ultrasound of the right upper quadrant** is the preferred initial imaging test to confirm acute cholecystitis and identify complications such as:
  - Gallstones
  - Gallbladder wall thickening
  - Pericholecystic fluid
  - Sonographic Murphy’s sign :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}

### When to Use Other Imaging

- If ultrasound is **non-diagnostic** and clinical suspicion remains high, consider:
  - **CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast** to assess for complications (e.g., perforation, abscess, gangrene)
  - **MRI / MRCP** where ultrasound/CT are inconclusive and local expertise allows :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}  
- Particularly consider CT when:
  - Patient is systemically unwell
  - Difficult or incomplete ultrasound windows
  - There is suspected complication (e.g., emphysematous cholecystitis, perforation) :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}

---

## Medical Treatment

- **Antibiotics** should be given to people who are systemically unwell or have signs of infection. :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}  
- Choice and route of antibiotic should follow **local antimicrobial guidance**. :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}  
- Continue supportive care and monitor for signs of resolution or deterioration. :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}

---

## Surgical and Interventional Management

### Early Cholecystectomy

- Early **laparoscopic cholecystectomy** during the same admission is recommended where appropriate and feasible, as this reduces recurrent symptoms and complications. :contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}  
- NICE quality standards recommend that adults with acute cholecystitis are offered **laparoscopic cholecystectomy within 1 week of diagnosis** where possible. :contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14}

### Percutaneous Cholecystostomy

- Consider **percutaneous cholecystostomy** in people who:
  - Are too ill for immediate surgery
  - Have significant comorbidity
  - Are not fit for general anaesthesia  
- This may act as a **bridge to definitive treatment** or palliation. :contentReference[oaicite:15]{index=15}

---

## Monitoring and Escalation

- Monitor for clinical deterioration including:
  - Increasing pain
  - Fever or rigors
  - Tachycardia or hypotension
  - Signs of perforation or sepsis  
- Review imaging and surgical referral urgently if findings or clinical condition worsen. :contentReference[oaicite:16]{index=16}

---

## Referral / Escalation Criteria

Urgent referral for surgical/critical care review is recommended when:

- Systemic sepsis is present  
- Imaging suggests complication (e.g., perforation, emphysematous cholecystitis)  
- Patient is deteriorating despite conservative management :contentReference[oaicite:17]{index=17}

---

## Summary – Key Imaging and Referral Actions

- Admit people with suspected acute cholecystitis for hospital assessment and management. :contentReference[oaicite:18]{index=18}  
- **Ultrasound** is first-line imaging. :contentReference[oaicite:19]{index=19}  
- If ultrasound is non-diagnostic or complications are suspected, proceed to **urgent contrast-enhanced CT**. :contentReference[oaicite:20]{index=20}  
- Early surgical referral should be considered, especially if complications are identified or the patient is systemically unwell. :contentReference[oaicite:21]{index=21}
