This section summarises recommended management of people presenting with acute renal or ureteric colic, including pain control, imaging, referral and escalation.

---

## 🚨 Initial Hospital Assessment

- People with suspected renal or ureteric colic should be **assessed urgently** and considered for admission if pain is severe or red flags are present (see below). :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  
- Assess vital signs and symptoms to identify systemic illness or complications. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

---

## 💊 Pain Management

- Offer a **non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)** (e.g., diclofenac or ibuprofen), unless contraindicated. NSAIDs are the most effective first-line analgesia for suspected acute renal colic. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  
- If NSAIDs are contraindicated or not sufficient:
  - Consider **intravenous paracetamol**.
  - Consider an **opioid analgesic** if pain remains uncontrolled. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

---

## 📊 Initial Investigations

- Urine dipstick to detect **haematuria** and rule out infection. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}  
- Blood tests where appropriate (e.g., renal function, inflammatory markers). :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}

---

## 🩺 Imaging

### Adults (Non-Pregnant)

- Offer **urgent low-dose non-contrast CT KUB** (CT of kidneys, ureters and bladder) within **24 hours** of presentation in suspected renal/ureteric colic. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}  
- CT KUB is the **most accurate imaging** modality and assists in confirming ureteric stones, impact, number, size and complication. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}

### Pregnant Patients

- Offer **ultrasound** as the first-line imaging test instead of CT to avoid radiation exposure. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}  
- If ultrasound is inconclusive and clinical suspicion remains, consider specialist imaging discussion (e.g., MRI) in consultation with radiology.

### Children and Young People

- For children and young people, start with **ultrasound** first. If uncertain, consider low-dose non-contrast CT. :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}

## 🛑 Red Flags and Urgent Referral

Urgent surgical/Urology or on-call admission should be considered in patients with:

- **Uncontrolled or intractable pain**
- **Sepsis or systemic infection**
- **Severe acute kidney injury / anuria**
- **Concern about alternative serious pathology**
- **Unexplained fever with suspected obstructed infected stone (pyonephrosis)** :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}

---

## 🌀 Special Considerations

- Most stones <5 mm will **pass spontaneously**; conservative management may be appropriate if pain is controlled and no complications are present. :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}  
- Clinical judgement is required when deciding between outpatient imaging and urgent referral depending on symptom severity and risk factors.

## 🧠 Summary – Key Actions

1. **Assess and stabilise** the patient with acute flank/loin pain. :contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}  
2. Give **NSAIDs first-line** for pain unless contraindicated. :contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14}  
3. Arrange **urgent non-contrast CT KUB** in adults to confirm diagnosis. :contentReference[oaicite:15]{index=15}  
4. Use **ultrasound** for pregnant patients and children initially. :contentReference[oaicite:16]{index=16}  
5. Urgently refer if red flags or complications are present. :contentReference[oaicite:17]{index=17}
