This summary focuses on the clinical recognition, investigation and referral practices for people with suspected acute diverticulitis, including uncomplicated and complicated presentations.

---

## Symptoms and Clinical Features

- Acute diverticulitis may present with **abdominal pain**, typically located in the **left lower quadrant**. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  
- Other symptoms can include:
  - Fever
  - Nausea or vomiting  
  - Changes in bowel habit  
- Features suggesting **complicated diverticulitis** (such as abscess, perforation or obstruction) include:
  - Severe, persistent pain
  - Signs of peritonitis
  - Systemic symptoms (e.g., tachycardia, hypotension)  
*Same-day hospital assessment is recommended if complicated features are present.* :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

## Initial Investigation and Referral

### Immediate Referral (Same Day)

- Refer people with **suspected complicated acute diverticulitis** to hospital for **same-day assessment**, particularly if:
  - There are systemic features of unwellness  
  - There are signs or symptoms suggestive of perforation, abscess, obstruction or generalised peritonitis  
  - There is concern about sepsis or clinical deterioration :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

### Diagnostic Tests

- CT scanning is central to modern diagnosis:
  - **Contrast-enhanced CT abdomen/pelvis** should be offered in people referred to hospital with suspected acute diverticulitis to confirm diagnosis and identify complications such as abscess or perforation.  
  - CT helps differentiate **uncomplicated** from **complicated** disease and guides management (e.g., conservative vs interventional).  
  - If contrast CT is contraindicated (e.g., severe allergy or renal impairment), alternatives such as MRI, ultrasound or non-contrast CT may be considered based on local expertise and clinical urgency. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}

## Non-Surgical Management

- **Oral antibiotics** or **intravenous antibiotics** may be considered based on clinical status:
  - Systemically unwell patients, immunocompromised individuals or those with complicated disease should be considered for hospital admission and **IV antibiotics**.  
  - Systemically well, immunocompetent patients with uncomplicated diverticulitis may be observed without routine antibiotics; clinical judgement and symptom progression should guide prescribing and review. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}

- The need for antibiotics should be reviewed within ~48 hours in line with antimicrobial stewardship and clinical progress. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}

## Imaging Use

- **CT abdomen/pelvis with contrast** is the first-line imaging modality in hospitalised patients with suspected acute diverticulitis, especially if complicated disease is suspected.  
- Imaging helps detect:
  - Abscesses
  - Free perforation
  - Inflammatory phlegmon
  - Obstruction
  - Other alternative diagnoses  
- CT findings help determine whether interventional radiology (e.g., percutaneous drainage) or surgery is required. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}

---

## Management of Abscesses

- In people with CT-confirmed diverticular abscess:
  - Percutaneous drainage may be considered if anatomically feasible.
  - Management choice (antibiotics alone vs drainage) should be discussed with surgical/interventional radiology teams.
  - Re-imaging may be considered if the clinical condition does not improve or deteriorates. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}

---

## Perforation and Complicated Disease

- People with **bowel perforation** or signs of **generalised peritonitis** require urgent surgical assessment.  
- Immediate surgical and critical care pathways should be initiated; do not delay for routine imaging beyond what is necessary to confirm acute pathology. :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}

---

## Summary – Key Referral and Imaging Actions

- **Refer for same-day hospital assessment** in people with suspected complicated acute diverticulitis. :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}  
- **CT abdomen/pelvis with contrast** is the preferred diagnostic imaging in hospital settings to confirm diverticulitis and detect complications. :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}  
- **Ultrasound, MRI or non-contrast CT** may be alternatives when contrast CT is contraindicated and local expertise allows. :contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}  
- Clinical deterioration, systemic unwellness, or peritonitis should prompt early surgical and radiological escalation.
