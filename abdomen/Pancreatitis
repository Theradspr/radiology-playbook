This summary describes key management recommendations for people diagnosed with acute pancreatitis, focusing on urgent care, supportive therapy and escalation of treatment.

---

## Initial Hospital Management

- **Emergency admission** is recommended for all people with suspected acute pancreatitis. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
- Initial supportive care includes:
  - **Intravenous fluid resuscitation**; appropriate fluids and rates based on clinical status. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}
  - **Supplemental oxygen** if required. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}
  - **Intravenous analgesia** for pain control. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}

---

## Antibiotics and Infection

- **Do not give routine antibiotics** solely to prevent infection in acute pancreatitis. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}
- Antibiotics may be appropriate for **confirmed infection**, particularly:
  - **Infected pancreatic necrosis**
  - Extra-pancreatic infections
  - Other sources of systemic infection associated with pancreatitis
- Choice of antibiotic should follow local protocols and culture results where possible. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}

---

## Nutrition

- In mild acute pancreatitis, people may **resume oral intake** as tolerated when nausea and pain have improved. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}
- In more severe cases, **enteral feeding** (tube nutrition) should be initiated as early as tolerated to maintain metabolic and intestinal mucosal integrity. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}
- **Parenteral nutrition** (intravenous nutrition) is generally reserved for cases where enteral feeding is not possible or adequate. :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}

---

## Imaging and Complications

- **Ultrasound** is commonly used early to assess for gallstones and biliary tract disease. :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}
- **CT imaging** with contrast is usually performed to:
  - Confirm diagnosis when the presentation is unclear  
  - Identify and evaluate **local complications** such as:
    - **Pancreatic necrosis**
    - Peripancreatic fluid collections
    - Abscess formation
  - Assess evolution of disease if clinical status worsens or fails to improve. :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}
- Routine repeat CT scans are **not recommended without clinical indication** (e.g., deteriorating condition or suspected complication). :contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}

---

## Severity Assessment and Monitoring

- Severity scores such as **APACHE II** or **CRP levels** may be used to help identify **severe acute pancreatitis** and the need for higher-level care. :contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14}
- People with **persistent organ dysfunction**, severe systemic responses, or complications should be considered for **intensive care monitoring**. :contentReference[oaicite:15]{index=15}

---

## Intervention for Local Complications

- Image-guided drainage or intervention may be appropriate for:
  - **Infected necrotic collections**
  - **Walled-off pancreatic necrosis** with clinical or radiological evidence of infection. :contentReference[oaicite:16]{index=16}
- **Fine needle aspiration (FNA)** to confirm infection may be considered when infection of collections is suspected. :contentReference[oaicite:17]{index=17}
- A **step-up approach** is recommended:
  1. Broad-spectrum antibiotics
  2. Image-guided drainage
  3. Surgical debridement or necrosectomy if needed :contentReference[oaicite:18]{index=18}

---

## Summary – Key Actions

- Admit all people with suspected acute pancreatitis for **supportive care**. :contentReference[oaicite:19]{index=19}
- Begin **IV fluids, oxygen and pain control** promptly. :contentReference[oaicite:20]{index=20}
- **Avoid routine prophylactic antibiotics**; treat infection when present. :contentReference[oaicite:21]{index=21}
- Use **ultrasound and CT imaging** appropriately based on clinical presentation and evolution. :contentReference[oaicite:22]{index=22}
- Escalate to **higher-level care** (ICU/level 2/3) for severe or complicated disease. :contentReference[oaicite:23]{index=23}
