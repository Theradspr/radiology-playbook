## Investigations

This page summarises recommended investigations for adults presenting with acute abdominal pain.

---

# General Principles

- Investigations should be guided by clinical assessment.
- Do not delay urgent referral while arranging primary care tests if red flags are present.
- Early senior review is recommended in suspected surgical abdomen.

---

# Initial Bedside Tests

## Urinalysis
- Perform in most people with acute abdominal pain.
- Helps identify urinary tract infection, renal colic, or haematuria.

## Pregnancy Test
- Mandatory in women of childbearing potential.
- Ectopic pregnancy must be excluded urgently.

## Observations
- Temperature
- Pulse
- Blood pressure
- Respiratory rate
- Oxygen saturation

Abnormal observations may indicate sepsis or haemodynamic instability.

# Blood Tests

Consider depending on presentation:

- Full blood count (FBC)
- C-reactive protein (CRP)
- Urea and electrolytes (U&Es)
- Liver function tests (LFTs)
- Amylase or lipase (if pancreatitis suspected)
- Lactate (if sepsis, shock, or mesenteric ischaemia suspected)
- Clotting screen if surgery anticipated

# Imaging

## Adults

### Suspected Surgical Cause
If diagnosis is uncertain but surgical pathology suspected:
- **CT abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast** is usually the first-line imaging modality.

### Suspected Biliary Disease
- **Ultrasound abdomen** is first-line.

### Suspected Renal Colic
- **CT KUB (non-contrast CT)**.

### Suspected Appendicitis
- CT abdomen/pelvis in most adults.
- Ultrasound may be used in younger adults or women of childbearing age.

### Suspected Gynaecological Cause
- Pelvic ultrasound (transabdominal ± transvaginal).

---

## Children and Young People

- Ultrasound preferred first-line imaging.
- Avoid CT unless clinically justified due to radiation exposure.

---

# When to Refer Urgently

Immediate hospital referral is required if:

- Peritonism
- Sepsis or suspected intra-abdominal sepsis
- Haemodynamic instability
- Severe or worsening pain
- Suspected ruptured AAA
- Suspected bowel obstruction
- Suspected mesenteric ischaemia

Do not delay referral for imaging in primary care if red flags are present.

---

# Plain Abdominal X-ray (AXR)

- Limited role in modern practice.
- May be considered in suspected bowel obstruction or perforation.
- Does not reliably exclude serious pathology.

CT is generally preferred where available.

# Summary – Imaging Referral Logic

| Clinical Suspicion | First-Line Imaging |
|--------------------|-------------------|
| Undifferentiated severe abdominal pain | CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast |
| Biliary pathology | Ultrasound |
| Renal colic | CT KUB |
| Appendicitis (adult) | CT abdomen/pelvis |
| Appendicitis (child/pregnant) | Ultrasound first |
| Suspected bowel obstruction | CT abdomen/pelvis |
| Suspected AAA | Ultrasound (stable) / CT if stable and rupture suspected |
