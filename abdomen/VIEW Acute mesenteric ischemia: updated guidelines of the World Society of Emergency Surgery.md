This page summarises key concepts for recognition, referral and imaging in suspected acute mesenteric ischaemia (AMI).

## What is AMI?

Acute mesenteric ischaemia is a surgical emergency caused by **interruption of blood supply to the intestine**, leading to ischaemia and potentially irreversible necrosis if untreated.  
Mortality remains high (>50%) without prompt diagnosis and treatment. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

AMI subtypes include:
- **Arterial embolism** (~50%)  
- **Arterial thrombosis** (~15–25%)  
- **Non-occlusive mesenteric ischaemia (NOMI)** (~20%)  
- **Mesenteric venous thrombosis (MVT)** (~5–15%) :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

## Clinical Presentation

### Symptoms
- Severe, sudden abdominal pain  
- Pain often **disproportionate to physical findings**  
- Nausea, vomiting  
- Diarrhoea, sometimes with blood  
- Later: peritonism, rigidity, shock signs :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

### Risk Factors
- Atrial fibrillation / embolic risk  
- Atherosclerotic disease  
- Heart failure  
- Hypotension/shock  
- Critical illness (NOMI context)  
- Hypercoagulable states (MVT) :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}

A high degree of suspicion is required because early signs may be non-specific. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}

## Diagnosis

### Laboratory Findings
- Elevated lactate often present but not always  
- Metabolic acidosis  
- Leukocytosis and raised inflammatory markers are common :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}

### Imaging

#### CT Angiography (CTA) – The Definitive Test
- **CTA with arterial and portal venous phases** is the imaging modality of choice.  
- CTA identifies arterial occlusion, venous thrombosis, bowel wall enhancement abnormalities, and signs of infarction.  
- CT signs include:
  - Reduced or absent bowel wall enhancement  
  - Mesenteric arterial or venous occlusion  
  - Pneumatosis intestinalis  
  - Portal venous gas  
  - Bowel dilatation :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}

CTA should be performed **urgently** in all patients with high clinical suspicion. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}

### Role of Other Modalities
- **Ultrasound**: limited role for acute AMI; may be helpful for MVT detection or as a quick adjunct but **not a definitive test**. :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}

## Management Principles

### Urgent Resuscitation and Referral
- Early resuscitation and correction of hypovolaemia  
- Early surgical and interventional radiology consultation :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}

### Revascularisation
- Arterial embolism or thrombosis may be treated with:
  - **Endovascular techniques** (angioplasty, thrombectomy)  
  - **Open surgery with embolectomy or bypass** :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}

Endovascular approaches have been associated with lower mortality and bowel resection rates when feasible. :contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}

### Mesenteric Venous Thrombosis
- Anticoagulation (e.g., heparin) is appropriate first-line  
- Imaging confirms extent and need for intervention :contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14}

## Surgical Decision Making

- **Bowel viability assessment** is crucial  
- Non-viable bowel requires resection  
- Techniques such as Doppler, fluorescein or near-infrared indocyanine green may aid intraoperative assessment but do not replace clinical judgement. :contentReference[oaicite:15]{index=15}

---

## Key Takeaways for ED / Radiology Referral

- **High clinical suspicion** is essential — early pain with non-specific signs should not be dismissed. :contentReference[oaicite:16]{index=16}  
- **Urgent CT angiography** is the cornerstone of diagnosis; do not delay for less sensitive tests. :contentReference[oaicite:17]{index=17}  
- Early involvement of surgical, vascular and interventional radiology teams improves outcomes. :contentReference[oaicite:18]{index=18}
