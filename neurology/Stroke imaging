## 1. Rapid Recognition & Initial Diagnosis

### Recognising Stroke / TIA

- Use a **validated tool** (e.g. FAST) outside hospital to screen people with sudden neurological symptoms for stroke/TIA. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  
- **Exclude hypoglycaemia** in people with sudden onset neurological symptoms. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  
- In emergency departments, use a validated tool (e.g. ROSIER) to rapidly establish diagnosis. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

### Initial Management in Suspected TIA

- **Offer aspirin 300 mg** daily immediately to people with suspected TIA, unless contraindicated. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}  
- Refer people with suspected TIA for **specialist assessment within 24 hours** of symptom onset. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}  
- **Do not use risk scores** like ABCD2 to guide urgency of referral. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}

## 2. Imaging After Suspected TIA / Acute Non-Disabling Stroke

### CT and MRI Imaging

- **Do not offer CT brain scanning** to people with suspected TIA *unless* clinical suspicion of an alternative diagnosis that CT could detect. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}  
- After specialist assessment, **consider same-day MRI** (including diffusion-weighted and blood-sensitive sequences) to determine ischaemic territory or detect haemorrhage/alternative pathology. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}

### Carotid Imaging (if candidate for endarterectomy)

- Offer **urgent carotid imaging** to people considered suitable for carotid endarterectomy if symptomatic carotid stenosis present. :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}  
- Report clearly which stenosis criteria (e.g. NASCET or ECST) were used. :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}

---

## 3. Acute Stroke Specialist Care

### Stroke Unit Admission

- **Admit all people with suspected stroke** directly to a specialist acute stroke unit after initial assessment. :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}

### Early Brain Imaging

Perform **immediate brain imaging** (non-contrast CT) in people with suspected acute stroke who have any of the following:

- Candidates for thrombolysis or thrombectomy  
- On anticoagulant treatment  
- Known bleeding tendency  
- Depressed level of consciousness (GCS < 13)  
- Unexplained progressive or fluctuating symptoms  
- Papilloedema, neck stiffness, fever  
- Severe headache at onset of symptoms  
:contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}

> If thrombectomy may be indicated, add **CTA (CT angiography)** and where relevant **CT perfusion imaging** (or MR equivalent), especially if beyond 6 hours from symptom onset. :contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14}

- In people without immediate imaging indications, perform **brain imaging as soon as possible and within 24 hours** of symptom onset. :contentReference[oaicite:15]{index=15}

---

## 4. Acute Treatment Pathways

### Thrombolysis & Thrombectomy

- **Thrombolysis** (e.g., alteplase or tenecteplase) is recommended within 4.5 hours of symptom onset when intracranial haemorrhage is excluded by brain imaging. :contentReference[oaicite:16]{index=16}  
- **Thrombectomy** should be offered as soon as possible:
  - Within **6 hours** for confirmed proximal anterior circulation occlusion  
  - Up to **24 hours** for selected wake-up strokes with salvageable brain tissue, supported by imaging (e.g. CT perfusion or DWI MRI). :contentReference[oaicite:17]{index=17}

---

## 5. Acute Antithrombotic & Supportive Treatments

### Antiplatelet & Anticoagulant Therapy

- Offer **aspirin 300 mg** (or rectal/enteral route if dysphagic) as soon as possible once haemorrhage is excluded and continue for 2 weeks before beginning long-term antithrombotic therapy. :contentReference[oaicite:18]{index=18}  
- Provide a proton-pump inhibitor if aspirin causes dyspepsia. :contentReference[oaicite:19]{index=19}  
- Do **not use anticoagulation routinely** for acute ischaemic stroke. :contentReference[oaicite:20]{index=20}

### Other Supportive Care

- Offer **anticoagulation** (e.g., full-dose heparin) for cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, unless contraindicated. :contentReference[oaicite:21]{index=21}  
- For acute arterial dissection, offer antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy. :contentReference[oaicite:22]{index=22}  
- Reverse anticoagulation promptly in haemorrhagic stroke (e.g., vit K, PCC for warfarin; follow MHRA advice for DOAC reversal). :contentReference[oaicite:23]{index=23}

---

## 6. Other Initial Management

### Homeostasis & Monitoring

- Give **supplemental oxygen** only if oxygen saturation < 95%. :contentReference[oaicite:24]{index=24}  
- **Maintain blood glucose** between 4–11 mmol/L. :contentReference[oaicite:25]{index=25}  
- For intracerebral haemorrhage, consider blood pressure lowering on a case-by-case basis; aim for systolic ~140 mmHg where appropriate. :contentReference[oaicite:26]{index=26}

### Swallowing, Nutrition & Hydration

- Screen **swallow function** before oral intake. :contentReference[oaicite:27]{index=27}  
- Arrange specialist swallowing assessment if screening is abnormal. :contentReference[oaicite:28]{index=28}  
- Assess and manage **hydration and nutrition** from admission. :contentReference[oaicite:29]{index=29}

---

## 7. Surgery & Neurosurgical Care

- Ensure protocols are in place for monitoring, referral, and transfer to neurosurgical centres for symptomatic hydrocephalus or other surgical urgencies. :contentReference[oaicite:30]{index=30}  
- **Consider decompressive hemicraniectomy** within 48 hours for people with large infarcts and clinical criteria suggesting potential benefit, with discussion of risks/benefits. :contentReference[oaicite:31]{index=31}
