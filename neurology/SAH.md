This page summarises key recommendations across:

- 1.1 Assessment and diagnosis  
- 1.2 Managing a confirmed aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage  
- 1.3 Monitoring and managing complications  
- 1.4 Follow-up care  

This is an imaging-focused operational summary for acute and specialist care.

# 1.1 Assessment and Diagnosis

## Initial Assessment

Maintain a high index of suspicion in people presenting with:

- Unexplained acute severe headache
- Thunderclap headache (peaks within 1–5 minutes)
- Neck stiffness
- Photophobia
- Nausea and vomiting
- Reduced consciousness
- Seizure
- Focal neurological deficit

Take a careful history of:
- Rate of onset
- Time to peak intensity

Do not delay referral while clarifying symptom descriptions.

Refer suspected cases immediately to emergency care if seen outside hospital.

Ensure urgent review by a senior clinical decision-maker in acute hospital settings.

---

## Initial Imaging

### Non-Contrast CT Head

Offer urgent non-contrast CT head if:

- Confirmed unexplained thunderclap headache
- Clinical suspicion of subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH)

Diagnostic accuracy is highest within 6 hours of symptom onset.

Diagnose SAH if CT shows blood in the subarachnoid space.

---

## Lumbar Puncture

If CT performed within 6 hours and reported by a radiologist is negative:
- Do not routinely offer lumbar puncture.
- Consider alternative diagnoses and discuss with senior clinician.

If CT performed more than 6 hours after symptom onset is negative:
- Consider lumbar puncture.
- Wait at least 12 hours after symptom onset before LP.

Diagnose SAH if LP shows elevated bilirubin (xanthochromia) on spectrophotometry.

If xanthochromia absent:
- Consider alternative diagnoses.

---

## Neurosurgical Referral

Urgently discuss confirmed SAH with a specialist neurosurgical centre.

Do not use severity scoring systems alone to determine transfer timing.

Rebleeding risk is highest within 24 hours.

---

## Identifying the Aneurysm

### CT Angiography (CTA)

Offer CT angiography without delay in confirmed SAH.

Diagnose aneurysmal SAH if:
- CTA shows intracranial aneurysm
- Blood distribution is compatible with rupture

If aneurysm identified but blood pattern not compatible:
- Seek urgent specialist opinion.

If CTA is negative and suspicion persists:
- Consider Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA)
- Consider MRA if DSA contraindicated

If no aneurysm detected:
- Consider alternative diagnoses.

---

# 1.2 Managing Confirmed Aneurysmal SAH

## Medical Management

### Nimodipine

- Consider enteral nimodipine.
- Use intravenous nimodipine only in specialist settings if enteral unsuitable.

### Venous Thromboembolism

Manage VTE risk according to NICE VTE guidance.

---

## Managing the Culprit Aneurysm

An interventional neuroradiologist and neurosurgeon must jointly assess management options:

- Endovascular coiling
- Neurosurgical clipping
- Conservative management with monitoring

Do not use severity scores alone to decide suitability.

If intervention appropriate:
- Offer endovascular coiling
- Offer clipping if coiling unsuitable

If intervention planned:
- Perform at earliest opportunity
- Rebleeding risk is highest in first 24 hours

Discuss and document final agreed treatment plan.

---

# 1.3 Monitoring and Managing Complications

## Transcranial Doppler

Do not use TCD to guide routine clinical management outside research settings.

---

## Neurological Deterioration

If unexplained deterioration occurs:
- Offer urgent non-contrast CT head first-line.

Assess for:
- Rebleeding
- Hydrocephalus
- Infarction
- Cerebral oedema

---

## Hydrocephalus

Diagnose based on:
- Symptoms and signs
- Comparison with prior imaging

### Acute Hydrocephalus
Consider CSF drainage or diversion if deterioration occurs.

### Chronic Hydrocephalus
Consider permanent CSF diversion.
If uncertain, trial temporary drainage.

---

## Delayed Cerebral Ischaemia (DCI)

- Maintain euvolaemia.
- Consider vasopressors if symptoms persist.
- Clinical improvement may be temporary.

---

# 1.4 Follow-Up Care

## Follow-Up Care Plan

Agree and document a follow-up plan including:

- Ongoing advice/support contacts
- Discharge documentation
- Copy provided to patient (and carers if appropriate)

---

## Rehabilitation

Offer rehabilitation according to:
- NICE stroke rehabilitation guidance
- NICE rehabilitation after critical illness guidance

---

## Follow-Up Neuroimaging

Consider based on:

- Type and outcome of aneurysm treatment
- Presence of non-culprit aneurysms
- Risk of rebleeding
- Risks of further investigation
- Patient preference

Modality and frequency should be individualised.

---

## Managing Non-Culprit Aneurysms

Multidisciplinary review required including:

- Interventional neuroradiologist
- Neurosurgeon

Options:
- Endovascular coiling
- Neurosurgical clipping
- Conservative management with monitoring

Consider:
- Size and location
- Lifetime rupture risk
- Treatment risk
- Comorbidities
- Patient preference

Document final agreed plan.

---

## Key Time-Critical Points

- CT head within 6 hours is highly sensitive.
- CTA should follow confirmed SAH immediately.
- Nimodipine should be started promptly.
- Secure aneurysm at earliest opportunity.
- Rebleeding risk highest in first 24 hours.
- Non-contrast CT is first investigation for deterioration.
