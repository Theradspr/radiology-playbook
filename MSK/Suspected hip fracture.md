# NICE CG124 – Imaging Options in Occult Hip Fracture

Offer **MRI** when hip fracture is suspected despite negative plain radiographs.  
Perform MRI within 24 hours if possible.  
If MRI is unavailable within 24 hours or contraindicated, **consider CT** as an alternative. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}
realistically CT is going to be done in the first instance so refer for this if X Ray NAD and struggling to mobilise.
